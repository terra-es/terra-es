(you must have git installed)
- fork the repo 
- clone the forked repo on your devide (git clone ... ) 
- create a new branch (git checkout -b Spanish-language) 
- make the changes 
- commit the changes (git add -A && git commit -m "Add Spanish language" )
- upload everything to your repo (git push origin Spanish-language ) 
- make a pull request (from the GitHub website)
